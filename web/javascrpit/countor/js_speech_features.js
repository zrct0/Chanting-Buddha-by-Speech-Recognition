从音频信号计算MFCC功能。
：param signal：用于计算特征的音频信号。应该是N*1数组
：param samplerate：我们正在处理的信号的采样率。
：param winlen：分析窗口的长度（秒）。默认值为0.025s（25毫秒）
：param winstep：连续窗口之间的步数（秒）。默认值为0.01s（10毫秒）
：param numcep：要返回的倒谱数，默认为13
：param nfilt:筛选器库中的筛选器数，默认为26。
：param nfft：FFT大小。默认值为512。
：param lowfreq:mel过滤器的最低频带边缘。在Hz中，默认值为0。
：param highfreq:mel过滤器的最高频带边缘。在Hz中，默认值是samplerate/2
：param preemph：使用preemph作为系数的preemphasis过滤器。0不是筛选器。默认值为0.97。
：param ceplifter：将一个lifter应用于最终的倒谱系数。0不是升降机。默认值为22。
：param appendEnergy：如果为真，则第0倒谱系数将替换为总帧能量的对数。
：param winfunc:要应用于每个帧的分析窗口。默认情况下不应用任何窗口。您可以在这里使用numpy窗口函数，例如winfunc=numpy.hamming
：返回：一个包含特征的numpy大小数组（numcep的NUMFRAMES）。每行包含一个特征向量。
